Python battleship logic 

## Why?
I was looking for a way to introduce my kids to some programming more complex than the block programming they've been doing so far.
Everybody understands the Battleship game and the logic is fairly basic.

The idea is to experiment with different algorithms for choosing where to shoot to most efficiently sink all the ships.
